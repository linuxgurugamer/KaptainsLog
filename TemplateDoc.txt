Template Documentation

Template files are located in the KaptainsLog/PluginData/HTMLTemplates folder

Templates consist of up to four files, one of which is required and the others are specified inside this file:

	templateConfig.cfg - Required


All of these entries are case sensitive.  The filenames for the header, detail and footer can be overridden in the config file

The template.cfg file is in the standed KSP config file format, and can contain the following optional entry fields:

	TemplateConfig
	{
		isHtml = true			// True if this is an HTML template, false otherwise
		isQuickExport = false	// True if this is a template for the Quick Export, false otherwise
		entriesPerPage = ##		// Specifies how many entries are put on each page.  If not there, then no paging is done.
		fileSuffix = html		// Optional file suffix
		header = header.tmpl	//
		detail = detail.tmpl
		footer = footer.tmpl

		// The following lines allow you to specify the IMG html for the different types of images
		// The default is shown.  
		// Note that you MUST leave the     [url]     which will be replaced by the file URL

		flagHtml = <img src="[url]">
		screenshotHtml = <img src="[url]">
		thumbnailHtml = <img src="[url]">

		headerImgHtml = <img src="[url]">
		footerImgHtml = <img src="[url]">
	}

If html = true, then the images are formatted with the appropriate HTML tags for images

Headers and footers have the following template fields.  These fields are replaced with the appropriate data from the logs.

	[HeaderImg]		Image file
	[FooterImg]		Image file
	[Page]			Page number
	[HeaderTitle]
	[FooterTitle]
	[Flag]

All of these can be used interchangably in both the header and footer templates.


Detail templates are used for each line being exported.  The following fields are available:

	[VesselName]
	[UniversalTime]
	[UTCtime]
	[MissionTime]
	[Situation]
	[MainBody]
	[ControlLevel]
	[Altitude]
	[Speed]
	[EventType]
	[Notes-0]		First line of notes, zero based
	[Notes-1]		Second line of notes
	[Notes]			All the notes
	[Screenshot]	Screenshots are only printed if selected on the log display 
	[Thumbnail]
	[VesselFlag]

Note that you can actually create a custom CSV export using this syntax
